    <div>
        <p>I am currently seeking a role as a Front-End Web Developer. I recently completed a 
            Full Stack Web Development program with UNC Charlotte's Extended Education Division where  
            I learned several programming languages such as HTML, CSS, 
            Javascript and Jquery.  I also learned the React Frameworks for building Full Stack Web 
            Development Applications: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

           Additionally, I am a Cum Laude graduate from the University of Texas at San 
           Antonio where I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Actuarial Science and Minor 
           in Applied Statistics.  I currently work at The Hartford Financial Services 
           Company as a Middle Market Insurance Underwriter.
    </p>

        <p> 
            
            In my role as an underwriter, I rely heavily on problem solving skills
            and team collaboration in order to provide my clients with the best possible
            solutions. For three consecutive years, I was awarded for 
            my ability to operate as a Team Player and  awarded on three separate occassions
            for my ability to deliver outcomes.  Because building an efficient and effective 
            web application requires Web Developers to execute these skills on a consistent
            basis, I have a proven track record of success that will translate very well in 
            a Front-End Developer role.
